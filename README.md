Testing out a new version of the API for my previous project, ITAIC. This time I am experimenting with the Firestore, Redis, RabbitMQ and Goji.
This is the combo package for backend, it contains the database API and the cache API.

This is still very early in development and is setup as such, so take all the code with a grain of salt.
# itaic-backend
